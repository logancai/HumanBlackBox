Google Glass Version

This is a working Google Glass application.

Notes:
This runs only on Google Glass. It will not run on regular Android phones.

Issues:
-As of the current GDK (Glass development kit) there is no SMS capabilites.
-OnActivityForResult does not get called for the camera.
-Our 3rd-party work-around does not work

This application is patent pending.
